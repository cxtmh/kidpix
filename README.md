In 1989 Kid Pix 1.0 was released into the public domain and this is an HTML/JS reimplementation.

### Guide
Just like the original Kid Pix, there's no guide—have fun!  Most of the tools support Shift (^) to enlarge. There are a handful of hidden tool features behind various modifier keys (⌘, ⌥, ⇧). The modifier keys can also be combined. Enjoy! :)
